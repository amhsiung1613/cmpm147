				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A generative overworld and dungeon landscape map with variation in each generative sequence as well as signs of life in some aspect.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The variation within the landscapes are done with Perlin noise functions. The rainfall follows the mouse y-axis via scrub and has a height variable that continuously brings it's height down. Hallways between dungeon rooms were created by calculatign the mid point of the first room and the mid point of the secodn room and creating a bath between the two rooms. I had wanted to incorporate a "room shake" effect to imply that the rooms were being destroyed but I couldn't figure it out in time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The most irritating part of this experiment has been autotiling, which I sitll can't get to work, and incorporating these two generators into my website. Website incorporation took a lot of trial and error since I wasnt sure which functions and variables were instance specific. It definitely took a lot of time to figure out.</p>
